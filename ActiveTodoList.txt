PHAZER: Add support for decalling: (used for random bump, shield patterns, dirt, etc)
    [For Older Games]
    - Let the user switch to the desired decal RigigMaterial
    - Let the user fiddle with the decal params
      - The decal params in older games are in the "extra material params" (already in UI), 
        I know how that works, so only minor changes
      - If the user picks, says, "DecalDirtmap", some of the extra params simply change names.
    - In the shader list there is a "Rome2/Attila" preset, which is just a copy of the qtRME one, which supports decalling
    - that way, they user can see the decalling change in render view with each param change without any changes to UI

    [For Newer Game Games]
        Only the decal param data source (xml.material system) is different.

Improve animation editor:
	Remove AnimTablePreviewWindow
	Support 3k
	Suppoert Rome 2/Attila 
	Select game
	Suppert warhammer matched combat 
	Show all files, even unsupported 
	Animation report => check that flag, set default if always the same 

Search window for binary data
Improve texture preview tool -> Global handle, open file

Bugs:
    PHAZER: .pack corruption too easy from UI .pack "empty folder". 
    Empty folders ofc cannot exist in the .pack format, (only in the UI), but something should prevent the corruption, 
    Solution Suggestions
      - like RPFM, remove a folder when its last file is removed
      - not allow user to save a .pack with empty folders, display Box "folder {name} empty, not allowed, delete or place file in folder."
      - put a dummy (like "empty.txt") file in any empty folders, if .pack is being saved with "empty folders".

DDS viwer 

// Texture transfer:
	We could work together on the texture transfer issue, 
	for example, 
	many large mod groups want to transfer their existing assets from Attila/Rome2 into Troy, right?
	And the MAIN problem with that is that Rome2/Attila/ToB
	uses a glossmap with the following channels:
	- glossmap.r = smoothness ( = 1.0f - roughness, if it follow PBR convention fully), this params controls the glossy BRDF (analytical light)
	- glossmap.g = reflectivity  this param controls that sharpness of the IBL relfection, in practice it is kinda of a lerp(diffuse_env_map, specular_env_map, reflectivity)

	whereas in troy, there is only 
	glossmap.r = smoothness which is a proper PBR parameter that affects both the IBL and the the glossy BRDF (analytical light) 
	The most obvious thing would be to just copy the smoothnes param, but i am not sure how that will look.
	Also, you need to gamma correct the Rome2/Atilla/Tob specular and diffuse textures in to SRGB space, as Troy expects textures to be in SRGB color space
