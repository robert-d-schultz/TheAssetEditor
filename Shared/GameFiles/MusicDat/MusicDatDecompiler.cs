    ///
    /// EXPRESSIONS. The VM is a stack machine whose slot operands are the compiler's
    /// static stack offsets, so they are not sequential and cannot be predicted by a
    /// counter. They do not need to be: a value-producing instruction never names its own
    /// destination, but its consumer names it, and producers are consumed in emission
    /// order. So each producer is left "pending" until a consumer appears, and the trailing
    /// pending producers are bound to that consumer's trailing slot operands. Operands not
    /// covered by a pending producer are looked up in the slot map, which keeps values
    /// alive across branches (an else-if chain loads the tested variable once and re-reads
    /// its slot in every arm).
    ///
    /// A function call whose result is used breaks the simple "trailing" rule: the
    /// compiler pushes a placeholder for the eventual return value right after the real
    /// arguments, so the last pending value at bind time is the placeholder, not the
    /// final argument. Context.BindArg resolves this by matching an argument bind to a
    /// pending value of the right type (a string argument is never the int placeholder)
    /// rather than by position, and Context.EmitCallOrExpr claims whatever placeholder is
    /// left once the call itself runs, folding "Foo(); if (slotN)" into "if (Foo())".
    ///
    /// CONTROL FLOW. JUMP_IF_FALSE spans an if-body; a trailing forward JUMP over a
    /// following region makes it an if/else. JUMP_3 (a switch/case chain's per-case test)
    /// gets the same if-body treatment with an unnamed placeholder condition, since the
